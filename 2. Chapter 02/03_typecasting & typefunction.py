#Typecasting is to "try" to convert 'a' string into int
a = str(a)    #Integer to String conversion 
a = int(a)    #String to Iinteger conversion 
a = float(a)  #Iinteger to Float conversion 

print(type(a))  # this is a type() function 
print(a + 4)

# if we write a = "dfsse" which is a type of string so that can't be change,
